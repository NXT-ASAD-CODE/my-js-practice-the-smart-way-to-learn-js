var totalCost1 = 1 + 3 * 4;
//there are two ways two solve this problem
// 1+3=> 4 and then multiply by four the answer will be 16
// 3 multiply by four => 12 and then add 1 => 13
// the correct answer will be 13
// this is because of BODMAS rule
var totalCost2 = (1 + 3)* 4; 
// in this problem first will be addition and then multiply because of the bracket
var resultOfComputation = ((2 * 4) * 4)+ 2;
// in  this problem first will solve inner barcket and then outer bracket and then rest of the problem

// if we want to assign a number is a variable we just want to write without the double qutation.
// for expample
var age = 20;
//we can also use the varible in the calculation purpose
//for example
var ageSum = age + 20;
console.log(ageSum);
// we can also do the addition with the varible name.
//for example 
var firstnum = 10;
var secoundnum = 25;
var totalnum = firstnum + secoundnum;
console.log(totalnum);
// if we want to add a string in a number the result will be
var number = "20";
console.log(number + 10);
// the illegel name of the variable is 
// var 1number => this is illegel
